Graph Theory Project: Dijkstra's Shortest Path and Steiner Tree Visualization

Project Overview

This Python-based project visualizes two essential graph theory algorithms: Dijkstra's Shortest Path and the Steiner Tree. It is designed for interactive learning and intuitive understanding, making it ideal for students and researchers.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Efficiently computes the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. The visualization highlights the step-by-step pathfinding process, making the algorithm's progression clear.

Steiner Tree Algorithm: Constructs the minimal network connecting a selected set of nodes, reducing the total edge weight. The visualization demonstrates how the optimal connections are formed.
